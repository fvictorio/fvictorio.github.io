published at HackMD.\nAn Ethereum node can be used to read the state of the blockchain or to send transactions that modify that state. To let you do this, Ethereum clients implement a protocol called JSON-RPC. This allows applications to rely on a (somewhat) standardized set of methods that should work with any client.\nSending a JSON-RPC call\nWe'll use Alchemy in these examples and, if you want to reproduce them, you'll need to get an API key from them. Even better, if you have a locally synced node, you can configure it to expose the JSON-RPC interface and use that instead.\nLet's say we want to get the latest block number of the Goerli network. To do that, we have to use the eth_blockNumber JSON-RPC method, which returns the current block number. We can send this method via curl, or any other HTTP client:\n$ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\", \"id\": \"1\", \"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\", \"params\":[]}' \\\nhttps://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/&lt;API_KEY&gt;\n\n{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"1\", \"result\": \"0x8a73e2\"}\n\nThis is a mouthful, but there are only a few crucial parts; the rest is just boilerplate:\n\nWe are sending an HTTP POST request to the Alchemy endpoint.\nThe body of the request is a JSON object. This object includes the name of the method we are calling, eth_blockNumber. It also has a list of params, which is empty in this case.\nWe receive a JSON object as the response, which includes a result field with the value we are interested in: the current block number, as a hexadecimal string.\n\nOther actions use other JSON-RPC methods. To send a signed transaction you use eth_sendRawTransaction, to get a transaction receipt you use eth_getTransactionReceipt, and so on.\nAll of this is meant to illustrate what happens under the hood each time you interact with a node. But we don't want to do something like that for everything.\nJSON-RPC networks in Hardhat\nYou can interact with nodes via JSON-RPC more easily using Hardhat. We'll see how to configure a network and then send calls to it.\nBefore starting, go to an empty directory and install Hardhat:\n$ cd /path/to/some/empty/directory\n$ npm install --save-dev hardhat\n\nNow create a hardhat.config.js file with this content:\nmodule.exports = {\n  networks: {\n    goerli: {\n      url: \"https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/&lt;API_KEY&gt;\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis is adding a network to the Hardhat configuration. To configure a network you need at least two things: a name, which in this case is goerli, and a URL. We could've used a different name here, like testnet, if we wanted.\nAfter setting this up, you can start a console connected to this network by running npx hardhat console --network goerli, or hh console --network goerli if you have installed the Hardhat shorthand. A node.js REPL will be started, where you can send JSON-RPC calls more easily:\n&gt; await network.provider.send(\"eth_blockNumber\", [])\n'0x8a733e'\n\nHere, network.provider is an object that implements the EIP-1193 standard. This is an abstraction with a minimal API used to interact with a node via JSON-RPC. When you use window.ethereum in a dapp, you are using an instance of a EIP-1193 provider exposed by the browser wallet.\nThe only part we care about here is that this object has a send function that receives the name of the method and a list of arguments.\nAside: the correct way to make calls in EIP-1193 is with the request method, but here we'll use the old send method because it's more concise.\nYou can have more than one network in your configuration:\nmodule.exports = {\n  networks: {\n    mainnet: {\n      url: \"https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/&lt;API_KEY&gt;\"\n    },\n    goerli: {\n      url: \"https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/&lt;API_KEY&gt;\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nBut you can only connect to one of them at a time. If we exit the console and run hh console --network mainnet, we can make the same call as before but to the mainnet network instead:\n&gt; await network.provider.send(\"eth_blockNumber\")\n'0xc607e5'\n\nLocal development node\nUsing a testnet for local development is slow, and you need to get test ether from a faucet. An easier and faster alternative is to use the local development node that comes with Hardhat. This node starts an instance of the Hardhat Network, which includes features like console.log and Solidity stack traces.\nIf you run hh node in a terminal, an HTTP server with this development node will start listening for requests in http://localhost:8545:\n$ hh node\nStarted HTTP and WebSocket JSON-RPC server at http://127.0.0.1:8545/\n\nAccounts\n========\nAccount #0: 0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 (10000 ETH)\nPrivate Key: 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80\n\n...\n\nYou can now connect to this network from another terminal running hh console --network localhost and make the same call as before:\n&gt; await network.provider.send(\"eth_blockNumber\")\n'0x0'\n\nThe response is 0x0 here because this is a new network that hasn't received any transactions.\nBut wait, what is this localhost network? We haven't added it to our config. The reason we can use it is that Hardhat comes with this pre-defined network, and it's pretty much equivalent to adding this:\nlocalhost: {\n  url: \"http://localhost:8545\"\n}\n\nSince connecting to this particular address and port is so common, Hardhat includes it by default. But you can explicitly add it to your config to customize it.\nSo now we have an easy way to develop locally. For example, if we want to run our tests, we can start a node in one terminal and then run hh test --network localhost in another. But this is very cumbersome. It means working with two different terminals and killing and starting the node again and again every time we want to start from scratch.\nLuckily, you don't need to do that. Besides localhost, Hardhat comes with another pre-defined network: hardhat. This is the same network used by the development node, but instead of starting an HTTP server, it's an in-process network that is created when you run your task, and killed at the end of it. So if you run hh test --network hardhat, the result will be pretty much equivalent to the combination of starting a new node, running hh test --network localhost, and then killing the node, all in one command.\nBesides, this is the default network, so you only need to do hh test.\nHardhat Network\nThis hardhat network is different from the other networks we have configured so far, because no HTTP server is started at all. Instead, the provider that will be exposed is connected to an in-process, ephemeral instance of the Hardhat Network. This might surprise you if you thought that you could only interact with JSON-RPC via HTTP, but the protocol is actually transport-agnostic.\nThe configuration options for the Hardhat Network are also different from the options for the external networks. For example, external networks have a url configuration field, but the Hardhat network configuration doesn't. On the other hand, the Hardhat network has a blockGasLimit option that doesn't exist for other networks.\nKeep in mind that the hardhat entry of your configuration is used to configure both the in-process network used by default, and the network started when you run hh node.\nEthers.js\nTechnically, you can do anything you want just with a JSON-RPC provider, but this is still a very low-level interface. Libraries like ethers.js offer a higher-level functionality to make your life easier.\nOne of these interfaces is a set of providers. These are like the EIP-1193 provider we've been used so far, but with many helper methods. For example, we previously called the eth_blockNumber method and got a hexadecimal string in response. With an ethers provider, you would do this instead:\n&gt; await anEthersProvider.getBlockNumber()\n9073582\n\nThere are two significant differences here: we use a specific and more readable method to get the current block number, and we get a number in response, not a hexadecimal string.\nHow do we convert our provider into an ethers.js provider? The easiest way is to use ethers.js's Web3Provider to wrap our existing provider. If you have ethers.js installed, you can start an hh console and execute this:\n&gt; const ethers = require(\"ethers\")\nundefined\n\n&gt; const anEthersProvider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(network.provider)\nundefined\n\n&gt; await anEthersProvider.getBlockNumber()\n9073591\n\nEven easier, you can use the @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers plugin. This plugin will add an ethers property to the Hardhat runtime environment, which has all the functionality from the ethers package, but that also includes some extra things, like an already initialized provider. So if you install the plugin, import it in your config, and then start a Hardhat console again, you'll be able to do this:\n&gt; await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber()\n9073599\n\nLearn more\n\nIf you want to know more about the JSON-RPC interface of Ethereum nodes, you can check the ethereum.org page. There is work in progress to have an up to date specification in the eth1.0-apis repository, which is used to generate this site.

Two of them (EIP-2929 and EIP-2930) affect how the gas cost of a transaction is computed. This article explains how (some) gas costs were calculated before Berlin, how this will change with EIP-2929, and how to use the Access Lists feature introduced by EIP-2930.\ntl;dr\nThis is a long article, so you can just read this and close the tab:\n\nThe Berlin hard fork changes the gas cost of some opcodes. If you have a hardcoded gas value in a dapp or a smart contract, they might stop working. And if this happens and the smart contract is non-upgradeable, consumers will need to employ access lists (EIP-2930) to use it.\nAccess lists can be used to reduce gas costs a little, but they could actually increase the total gas consumed in some scenarios.\ngeth includes a new RPC method called eth_createAccessList to simplify the creation of access lists.\n\nGas costs before Berlin\nEach opcode executed by the EVM has an associated gas cost. For most of them, this cost is fixed: PUSH1 always consumes 3 units of gas, MUL consumes 5, and so on. For others it is variable: the SHA3 opcode's cost depends on the size of its input, for example.\nWe'll focus on the SLOAD and SSTORE opcodes since they are the ones most affected by the Berlin hard fork. We'll talk later about those that target an address, like all the EXT* and CALL* opcodes, since their gas cost changes too.\nSLOAD before Berlin\nWithout EIP-2929, the cost of SLOAD is simple: it always costs 800 of gas. So there isn't much to say about it (for now).\nSSTORE before Berlin\nSSTORE is maybe the most complex opcode in terms of gas because its cost depends on things like the current value of the storage slot, the new value, and whether it was previously modified. We'll analyze only some scenarios to get a basic understanding; if you want to learn more, read the EIPs linked at the end of this article.\n\nIf the value of the slot changes from 0 to 1 (or any non-zero value), the cost is 20000\nIf the value of the slot changes from 1 to 2 (or any other non-zero value), the cost is 5000.\nIf the value of the slot changes from 1 (or any non-zero value) to 0, the cost is also 5000, but you get a gas refund at the end of the transaction. We won't cover refunds in this article since they are not affected by Berlin.\nIf the value was previously modified during the same transaction, all the subsequent SSTOREs cost 800.\n\nThe details are not that interesting here. The important part is that SSTORE is expensive and that its cost depends on several factors.\nGas costs after EIP-2929\nEIP-2929 changes all these values. But before getting into that, we need to talk about an important concept introduced by the EIP: accessed addresses and accessed storage keys.\nAn address or a storage key is considered accessed if it was previously \"used\" during the transaction. For example, when you CALL another contract, the address of that contract is marked as accessed. Similarly, when you SLOAD or SSTORE some slot, it will be considered accessed for the rest of the transaction. It doesn't matter which opcode did it: if an SLOAD reads a slot, it will be considered accessed for both the next SLOADs and the next SSTOREs.\nSomething important to notice here is that storage keys are \"inside\" some address. As the EIP explains it:\n\nWhen executing a transaction, maintain a set accessed_addresses: Set[Address] and accessed_storage_keys: Set[Tuple[Address, Bytes32]]\n\nThat is, when we say that a storage slot is accessed, we are actually saying that a pair (address, storageKey) was accessed.\nWith that being said, let's talk about the new gas costs.\nSLOAD after Berlin\nBefore Berlin, SLOAD had a fixed cost of 800. Now, it depends on whether that storage slot was already accessed or not. If it wasn't accessed, the cost is 2100; if it was, it is 100. So, an SLOAD costs 2000 less if the slot is in the list of accessed storage keys.\nSSTORE after Berlin\nLet's revisit our previous SSTORE examples in the context of EIP-2929:\n\nIf the value of the slot changes from 0 to 1 (or any non-zero value), the cost is:\n\n22100 if the storage key wasn't accessed\n20000 if it was\n\n\nIf the value of the slot changes from 1 to 2 (or any other non-zero value), the cost is:\n\n5000 if the storage key wasn't accessed\n2900 if it was\n\n\nIf the value of the slot changes from 1 (or any non-zero value) to 0, the cost is the same as the previous item, plus the refund.\nIf the value was previously modified during the same transaction, all the subsequent SSTOREs cost 100.\n\nAs you can see, the first SSTORE costs 2100 less if the slot it's modifying was previously accessed.\nPutting it all together\nThat was a mouthful, so here's a table comparing all the values mentioned so far:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        OPCODE\n        Before Berlin\n        After Berlin\n      \n      \n        Not accessed\n        Accessed\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        SLOAD\n        800\n        2100\n        100\n      \n      \n        SSTORE from 0 to 1\n        20000\n        22100\n        20000\n      \n      \n        SSTORE from 1 to 2\n        5000\n        5000\n        2900\n      \n      \n        SLOAD + SSTORE*\n        5800\n        5000\n        3000\n      \n      \n        SSTORE* + SLOAD\n        5800\n        5100\n        3000\n      \n      \n        SSTORE of an already written slot\n        800\n        100\n      \n      \n        \n          \n            *From a non-zero value to a different non-zero value, like in the third row\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\nNotice that in the last row it doesn't make sense to talk about the slot having been accessed or not because, if it was previously written, then it was also accessed.\nEIP-2930: Optional Access List transactions\nThe other EIP we mentioned at the beginning was EIP-2930. This EIP adds a new type of transaction that can include an access list in the transaction payload. This means that you can declare beforehand which addresses and slots should be considered as accessed before the transaction's execution starts. For example, an SLOAD of a non-accessed slot costs 2100, but if that slot was included in the transaction's access list, then that same opcode will cost 100.\nBut if the gas costs are lower when an address or storage key is already accessed, does this mean that we can add everything to the transaction's access list and get a gas reduction? Yay, free gas! Well, not exactly, because you also need to pay gas for each address and each storage key that you add.\nLet's see an example. Say we are sending a transaction to contract A. An access list could look like this:\naccessList: [{\n  address: \"&lt;address of A&gt;\",\n  storageKeys: [\n    \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n  ]\n}]\n\nIf we send a transaction with this access list, and the first opcode that uses the 0x0 slot is a SLOAD, it will cost 100 instead of 2100. That's a gas reduction of 2000. But each storage key included in the transaction's access list has a cost of 1900. So we only save 100 of gas. (If the first opcode to access that slot is an SSTORE instead, we would save 2100 of gas, which means that we'd save 200 of gas in total if we consider the cost of the storage key.)\nDoes this mean that we always save gas when using transaction's with access lists? Well, no, because we also pay gas for the address in the access list (\"&lt;address of A&gt;\" in our example).\nAccessed addresses\nSo far, we've been talking only about the SLOAD and SSTORE opcodes, but those aren't the only ones that change after Berlin. For example, the CALL opcode had a fixed cost of 700. But after EIP-2929 its cost is 2600 if the address is not in the access list and 100 if it is. And, like the accessed storage keys, it doesn't matter what OPCODE accessed that address before (for example, if an EXTCODESIZE was called first, then that opcode will cost 2600, and any subsequent EXTCODESIZE, CALL, STATICCALL that uses the same address will cost 100).\nHow is this affected by transactions with access lists? For example, if we send a transaction to contract A, and that contract calls another contract B, then we can include an access list like this:\naccessList: [{ address: \"&lt;address of B&gt;\", storageKeys: [] }]\n\nWe'll have to pay a cost of 2400 to include this access list in the transaction, but then the first opcode that uses the address of B will cost 100 instead of 2600. So we saved 100 of gas by doing this. And if B uses its storage somehow and we know which keys it will use, then we can also include them in the access list and save 100/200 of gas for each one (depending on whether the first opcode is an SLOAD or an SSTORE).\nBut why are we talking about another contract? What happens with the contract that we are calling? Why don't we do this?\naccessList: [\n  {address: \"&lt;address of A&gt;\", storageKeys: []},\n  {address: \"&lt;address of B&gt;\", storageKeys: []},\n]\n\nWe could do it, but it wouldn't be worth it because EIP-2929 specifies that the address of the contract that is being called (that is, tx.to) is always included in the accessed_addresses list. So we are paying 2400 more for nothing.\nLet's analyze our example of the previous section again:\naccessList: [{\n  address: \"&lt;address of A&gt;\",\n  storageKeys: [\n    \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\n  ]\n}]\n\nThis will actually be wasteful unless we include several storage keys more. If we assume that a storage key is always used first by an SLOAD, then we need at least 24 storage keys just to break even.\nAs you can imagine, analyzing this and creating an access list by hand is not fun. Luckily, there is a better way.\nThe eth_createAccessList RPC method\nGeth (starting from version 1.10.2) includes a new eth_createAccessList RPC method that you can use to generate access lists. It is used like eth_estimateGas, but instead of a gas estimation, it returns something like this:\n{\n  \"accessList\": [\n    {\n      \"address\": \"0xb0ee076d7779a6ce152283f009f4c32b5f88756c\",\n      \"storageKeys\": [\n        \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n        \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"gasUsed\": \"0x8496\"\n}\n\nThat is, it gives you the list of addresses and storage keys that will be used by that transaction, plus the gas consumed if the access list is included. (And, like eth_estimateGas, this is an estimation; the list could change when the transaction is actually mined.) But, again, this doesn't mean that this gas will be lower than the gas used if you just send the same transaction without an access list!\nI suppose we'll discover over time what's the proper way of doing this, but my pseudo-code guess is this:\nlet gasEstimation = estimateGas(tx)\nlet { accessList, gasUsed } = createAccessList(tx)\nif (gasUsed &gt; gasEstimation) {\n  delete accessList[tx.to]\n}\ntx.accessList = accessList;\nsendTransaction(tx)\n\nUnbricking contracts\nIt is important to mention that the main purpose of Access Lists is not to use gas. As the EIP explains it:\n\nMitigates contract breakage risks introduced by EIP-2929, as transactions could pre-specify and pre-pay for the accounts and storage slots that the transaction plans to access; as a result, in the actual execution, the SLOAD and EXT* opcodes would only cost 100 gas: low enough that it would not only prevent breakage due to that EIP but also “unstuck” any contracts that became stuck due to EIP 1884.\n\nThis means that if a contract makes assumptions about the cost of executing something, the increase in gas costs could break it. For example, a contract makes a call to another contract like someOtherContract.someFunction{gas: 34500}() because it assumes that someFunction will use exactly 34500 of gas, then it will break. But if you include the proper access list in the transaction, then the contract will work again.\nCheck it yourself\nIf you want to test this yourself, clone this repo which has several examples that can be executed using Hardhat and geth.

You use a specific language for these requests, even if you are not aware of it.\nFinally, a shell is used to run programs. You can do other things with it, but that's its main purpose.\n\nLet's explore this definition in more detail.\nRunning programs\nThe first thing we need to understand is that a program is always started from another program.1 Who started that other program, you might ask? Well, of course: a third program. And who started that one? Yet another program. But who...? I don't know, a turtle or something.\nThe details of what exactly a program does to start another one are not relevant for our purposes. We can just assume that there is a function that looks like this:\nfunction runProgram(\n  pathToProgram: string,\n  arguments: string[],\n  environmentVariables?: Record&lt;string, string&gt;\n)\n\nThis is a crude simplification, but it will do. At its core, starting a program requires its path in the filesystem and a list of arguments. We can also optionally pass a dictionary of environment variables.\nWith this function and our previous definition, we can try to write a very simple and useless shell.\nThe worst shell in the world\nSince we defined a shell as a program that interprets requests to run programs and assumed we have a runProgram function, we can write an extremely simple shell that just runs whatever program is passed to it:\nwhile (true) {\n  const pathToProgram = readLine();\n  runProgram(pathToProgram, []);\n}\n\nThis would be extremely useless, but it does the job. You input a path to the program you want to run, our shitty shell interprets your request verbatim, and that's it. But a real shell does much more than that.\nFinding programs\nWhen you want to run the df program to see if you have enough space to keep downloading buying movies, you don't write /usr/bin/df, you just write df. This wouldn't work on our dumb implementation, but it does in any real shell.\nThe reason this works is that the shell will check a list of pre-defined directories to see if any of them contains a program with that name. You probably already know that this list is in the PATH environment variable. We can easily add this feature to our previous snippet, especially if we assume that we have more magic functions available:\nwhile (true) {\n  const program = readLine();\n  const pathToProgram = findProgram(process.env.PATH, program);\n\n  if (pathToProgram) {\n      runProgram(pathToProgram, []);\n  } else {\n      console.error(`No program named '${program}' was found`);\n  }\n}\n\nNow we are doing some interpretation.\nBut what if we want to pass some arguments to a program? If we run rm Titanic.mkv we'll get this:\nNo program named 'rm Titanic.mkv' was found\n\nWhich makes sense! We are taking the full line and interpreting it as a program name. Whitespace is not special, and neither are you.\nWhat we need here is some more of that sweet interpretation.\nParsing arguments\nLet's update our shell to interpret whitespace as a separator between the name of the program and the arguments:\nwhile (true) {\n  const line = readLine();\n\n  const [program, ...args] = line.split(/\\s+/g);\n\n  const pathToProgram = findProgram(process.env.PATH, program);\n  if (pathToProgram) {\n      runProgram(pathToProgram, args);\n  } else {\n      console.error(`No program named '${program}' was found`);\n  }\n}\n\nIf this code actually worked and we ran rm Titanic.mkv on it, it would actually delete the file. Probably. In any case, the takeaway is that we are doing a more complex interpretation of the command we receive. The command is still just a string, but we are starting to parse it in a somewhat interesting way.\nGlobs\nWhat if you want to remove all the files that end in .mkv in a directory? It's easy with our shell: you just run ls, then write rm , and then manually add all the files that end with that extension. I'm sure you won't make any typos.\nIf you don't like typing, then there are some ways this could be automated. Maybe you could use a version of rm that, instead of a list of files, receives an extension as its argument and removes all the files with that extension. Or perhaps you could have one program that writes all the files with some extension to a file, and then pass that file to another program which consumes it and removes all the files pointed by it...\n...or you could just add a new feature to the shell. You could say that, if the shell finds something like *.mkv, then it will interpret it as \"all the files in the current directory that end in mkv\". This is called glob expansion or globbing. Globs are like regular expressions, but worse, or better; it's hard to say.\nThe important part here, and probably the most important part of this article, is that this expansion is performed by the shell! This is quite easy to check by writing a program that just prints its arguments. With Node.js, you can do something like this:\n// index.js\nconst arguments = process.argv.slice(2);\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(arguments));\n\nIf you run node index.js 1 2 foo, you will get the list [\"1\",\"2\",\"foo\"]. (Don't pay too much attention to the .slice(2) part, this just avoids printing the paths to the node binary and the script, which are included in the arguments list for what I'm sure are very good reasons.)\nIf you now create some files:\n$ touch a.txt b.txt c.txt\n\nAnd then run node index.js *.txt, the program will print [\"a.txt\",\"b.txt\",\"c.txt\"], not [\"*.txt\"].\nThings like * are called metacharacters. These are characters that receive a special treatment by the shell. There are a lot of these, like ?, |, &lt; and &gt;.\nBut now you, being a smart and curious person, are wondering: \"what if I actually want to pass *.txt as an argument to a program, for my own devious purposes?\".\nQuotes\nThis is one of the things you might do without fully understanding. You run something in the shell; it doesn't work and you get a scary error message. You try adding some quotes. Now it works. Success! But what did actually happen?\nHere I'm going to quote from The UNIX Programming Environment again.\n\nGiven the number of shell metacharacters, there has to be some way to say to the shell, \"Leave it alone\". The easiest and best way to protect special characters from being interpreted is to enclose them in single quote characters:\n$ echo '***'\n***\n$\n\n\nHonestly, you should just close this tab and go read Chapter 3 from that book. It's so good.\nBut yes: you use single or double quotes to escape metacharacters. Single quotes escape everything, double quotes allows certain expansions within them. I think a good thumb of rule is \"always use single quotes unless you know what you're doing\".\nSo, going back to the question in the previous section, if you want to literally pass *.txt as an argument to a program, you can do:\n$ rm '*.txt'\n\nAnd if you have a file that is literally named *.txt then 1) you are a monster and 2) it will be removed.\nYou can also try this with the little script we wrote before:\n$ node index.js '*.txt'\n[\"*.txt\"]\n\nEnvironment variables\nSo far, we've called our runProgram function without passing any environment variables. The default behavior in this case is that the environment of the parent process will be passed to the child process (or maybe some of them are changed? I'm fuzzy on the details here).\nWhat if you want to run a program with some specific environment variables? Most shells let you do this with a special syntax. In bash/zsh/fish, for example, you can do:\n$ FOO=1 BAR=2 program arg1 arg2\n\nThat is, you can prepend the program name with a list of environment variables. As before, it's easy to write a little script to test this out:\n// index.js\nconsole.log(process.env.FOO);\n\nRunning node index.js will print undefined but running FOO=1 node index.js will print 1.\nThere is an alternative way to do this that you've surely seen before, but which is not exactly equivalent:\n$ export FOO=1\n$ node index.js\n1\n\nThe difference here is that export FOO=1 is modifying the environment of the shell, which is then passed down to our script. This is persistent: if we run node index.js a second time in the same shell session, it will print 1 again. But if we do that with the previous version (assuming a fresh shell instance), it won't:\n$ FOO=1 node index.js\n1\n$ node index.js\nundefined\n\nBuilt-in commands\nThe most interesting part of the previous section is export FOO=1. This is an example of running a command in the shell that doesn't execute a program. export here is what's called a built-in command of the shell.\nWhen you run things like df, rm, vim or whatever, there is an actual file in your disk with the code for that program. You can use whereis to find the path to that file:\n$ whereis df\ndf: /usr/bin/df /usr/share/man/man1/df.1.gz\n\nBut if you do the same with a built-in, you get a sad void:\n$ whereis export\nexport:\n\nWhy do we have built-ins? Why isn't everything a program?\nIn many cases, the reason is that the built-in does something that can't be done by a program. For example, export modifies the environment of the shell and cd changes its current directory. This is something that can't be done by a program, because a program can't make these modifications to its parent process.2\nIn any case, if you want to know if a command is a built-in or not, you can use the type command:\n$ type export\nexport is a shell builtin\n\nType is, of course, a builtin:\n$ type type\ntype is a shell builtin\n\nExamples!\nOk, now for the fun part. Let's use what we learned to explore some interesting examples.\nExample 1: The -- separator\nLet's start with an easy one. Sometimes you run a command that, in turn, runs another command. For example, let's say you are working on a Rust command line program. You can run it during development with cargo run and pass arguments to it.\ncargo run someArg\n\nIn this case, your program will receive someArg as an argument.\nNow imagine you added support for a new --foo flag and you want to try it out. If you do this:\n$ cargo run --foo someArg\n\nyou'll get an error:\nerror: Found argument '--foo' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context\n\n  If you tried to supply '--foo' as a value rather than a flag, use '-- --foo'\n\nWhat's happening here is that cargo thinks that --foo is a flag for cargo run, not for your program. A similar thing happens when you do npm run some-script and want to pass some arguments to the command executed by the script.\nIn both cases, the solution is to add a --. If we run cargo run -- --foo, then it will work fine. -- here is a special argument that changes how Cargo (or npm) interprets the rest of its arguments.\nWhat does the shell do with --? Hopefully the answer is obvious: nothing. This is not a metacharacter. Using -- is just a convention used by many programs to change how they interpret their arguments; the shell doesn't care about it.\nExample 2: Escaping quotes\nIf you want to pass an argument that actually contains a quote, you can escape it with the other type of quote. That is:\n$ echo 'The \"quick\" brown fox'\nThe \"quick\" brown fox\n$ echo \"The 'quick' brown fox\"\nThe 'quick' brown fox\n\nIf you want to include both kinds of quotes, you could do this:\n$ echo \"The 'quick' brown \\\"fox\\\"\"\n\nBut, as mentioned before, it's better to use single quotes by default. The problem is that you can't escape single quotes with a backslash in bash and zsh (you can in fish, but let's ignore that). So, if you want to pass a parameter that contains both double quotes and single quotes and you want to use single quotes for most of it, you have to do this:\n$ echo 'The '\"'\"'quick'\"'\"' brown \"fox\"'\nThe 'quick' brown \"fox\"\n\nThe key to understand this monstrosity is that you can concatenate quotes strings. All of these are equivalent:\n$ echo foobarbaz\nfoobarbaz\n$ echo \"foo\"\"bar\"\"baz\"\nfoobarbaz\n$ echo 'foo'\"bar\"'baz'\nfoobarbaz\n\nIf that makes sense, and if you squint hard enough, then you can understand the previous example. Here it is again, which each part in a different line:\n$ echo 'The '\\\n&gt; \"'\"\\\n&gt; 'quick'\\\n&gt; \"'\"\\\n&gt; ' brown \"fox\"'\nThe 'quick' brown \"fox\"\n\nFor a good, alternative explanation of this, check this answer on StackOverflow.\nExample 3: Conditions in bash programming\nSo far everything we've seen is related to running programs. But the language interpreted by shells like bash is pretty much a full programming language, including things like conditionals. For example, you can do:\nif [ 3 -gt 1 ]\nthen\n  echo \"3 is greater than 1\"\nelse\n  echo \"Math is broken\"\nfi\n\nNow, you might think that the syntax for an if statement is something like this:\nif [ &lt;conditions&gt; ]\nthen\n  &lt;true&gt;\nelse\n  &lt;false&gt;\nfi\n\nWhere &lt;conditions&gt; uses a terrible syntax. But the actual syntax is this:\nif &lt;command&gt;\nthen\n  &lt;true&gt;\nelse\n  &lt;false&gt;\nfi\n\nWhere &lt;true&gt; will be executed if the command exits with a zero status code, and &lt;false&gt; will be executd if the command exits with a non-zero code.\nWait, does that mean that...?\n$ whereis [\n[: /usr/bin/[ /usr/share/man/man1/[.1.gz\n\nYes: [ is a program.3 It receives a list of arguments that are interpreted as conditions, and exits with a zero exit code if its arguments evaluate to true, and non-zero otherwise. Actually, [ is kind of an alias to the test command.\n$ test 3 -gt 1\n$ echo $?\n0\n$ test 3 -gt 3\n$ echo $?\n1\n\n(Here we are using the $? variable, which contains the exit code of the last command, to check the result of the test command.)\nAnd I said \"kind of an alias\" because [ is not exactly the same as test.\n$ [ 3 -gt 1\nbash: [: missing `]'\n\nAs you can check by running man test, [ is pretty much the same as test, except that it requires a ] as its last argument.\nFun stuff.\nClarifications\nThere are a lot of simplifications in this article. Some of them are there to make the explanation easier to understand, and some of them are due to my own ignorance. This is a list of the ones I'm aware of and that I think are important:\n\nEverything here is very UNIX specific. I think the core ideas apply to non-UNIX operating systems, but many of the details are probably different.\nI didn't mention system calls at all, even if they are relevant for a more common definition of a shell: \"a shell is a program that provides an interface to the operating system\". This is probably a technically better definition, but I wanted to focus on the \"interprets requests to run programs\" part.\nThe environment is actually a list of strings, not a dictionary. These strings, by convention, look like key=value and are interpreted as a dictionary by programs and standard libraries.\n\nFurther reading\nThe UNIX Programming Environment is a classic. It's a bit dated, but it's a great read anyway.\nAdvanced Programming in the UNIX Environment is a more modern and technical book. I haven't read it cover to cover, not even 10% of it, but it's great as a reference.\nFootnotes\n1\nI'm going to use \"program\" for both \"programs\" and \"processes\". There are a million explanations out there about the difference, so I won't bother here.\n\n2\nThere are also many built-in commands that have a program equivalent with the same name. For example, echo is a built-in command in bash, but there is also a /usr/bin/echo program. I'm not completely sure why this is the case, but one answer seems to be \"POSIX\", a topic I won't delve into.\n\n3\nI'm cheating a bit here. [ is actually a shell built-in, but there's also a program with the same name and functionality, similar to echo. Check the previous footnote for an explanation.\n\n","id":"https://fvictorio.github.io/posts/you-and-your-shell/","title":"You and Your Shell"}},"docInfo":{"https://fvictorio.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://fvictorio.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://fvictorio.github.io/posts/hardhat-networks-and-providers/":{"body":815,"title":3},"https://fvictorio.github.io/posts/understanding-gas-costs-after-berlin/":{"body":1125,"title":4},"https://fvictorio.github.io/posts/you-and-your-shell/":{"body":1503,"title":1}},"length":5},"lang":"English"};
